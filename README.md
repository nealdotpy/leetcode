#### Organized repository for collecting Leetcode solutions and helping to motivate the end-goal of solving at least three problems daily. 
Perfect/smart practice makes a master/expert.

# NOTE

This repository is no longer used to host leetcode solutions. In order to better prepare, solutions are typed directly into a Google Doc when I practice (mimicking many live interview environments).
