130. Surrounded Regions - Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/

Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), 
capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's 
in that surrounded region.

X X X X 
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X

-> run ->

X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X

Explanation:

Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means 
that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. 
Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to 
an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are 
connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally 
or vertically.
